# Prediction-of-non-functional-water-pumps
##  Project Description
The ministry of water of an African country has made a data set of pumps 
installed in various places in the country to serve the water for their countrymen. It is a 
tedious and expensive task to maintain these pumps. This data set contains information 
such as the kind of pump, when it was installed, and how it is managed. We tried to predict 
which pumps require repairs and which are not functional by using the given data set. A 
smart understanding of water point failure can improve maintenance operations and ensure 
that clean and safe water is available to these communities.Implementation of all ML algorithms, data preprocessing and hyperparameters selection were done using inbuilt function from 
scikit learn library in python. All code is present in a single jupyter notebook "code_pumps.ipynb" file and was run on google colab server.
